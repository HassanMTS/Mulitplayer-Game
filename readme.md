# Game Server Backend

This repository contains the backend server for a multiplayer game using Node.js, `nodemon`, and `socket.io`.

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/HassanMTS/Mulitplayer-Game.git)
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd game-server
npm install
```

## Usage

### Start the Server

To start the server using `nodemon`, run the following command:

```bash
npm start
```

This will automatically restart the server whenever you make changes to the code.

### Connect and Disconnect Players

Players can connect to the server using a WebSocket connection. The server will handle player connection and disconnection events.

### Remove Enemies

To remove enemies, implement the necessary logic in your code. You may want to broadcast a message to all connected clients to notify them about the removal of enemies.

### Initial Connection

When a player connects to the server, an initial connection event is triggered. You can handle this event to set up the player's initial state or perform any necessary tasks.

### Create New HTTP Server

The server creates a new HTTP server to handle WebSocket connections using `socket.io`. The HTTP server listens on a specified port.

### Create First Player Using Sockets

The server uses `socket.io` to handle WebSocket connections. When a player connects, you can create the first player by handling the connection event.

### Create Multiple Players with Sockets

As more players connect to the server, handle the connection event for each player to create and manage multiple players.

### Remove Players on Disconnect and Timeout

Players are removed from the server when they disconnect or timeout. Implement the necessary logic to handle player disconnection and removal.
